# DndBot
A silly bot I made to help manage a Dungeons & Dragons Campaign

## Commands

```
/inspiration read
```

```

### Insults

To list insults for a specific Dungeons & Dragons species:
```

```

The amount of insults to generate is optional. If no amount is provided, all stored insults will be shown. Credit to /u/ThoughtEater1 for compiling the slurs [here](https://www.reddit.com/r/DnD/comments/6na3hi/i_compiled_a_list_of_racial_slurs_for_you_to_use/)
